# Aims and Objectives
In this project, the aim is to explore the use of artificial intelligence to identify glaucoma severity by annotating the affected area found by the optic nerve. Specifically, the application of convolutional neural networks with image processing techniques will be used to process retinal fundus images supplied by the RIGA dataset.

As a co-aim of the project, the software engineering development methodology of Test-Driven Methodology will be applied. This will be used as part of a metric to measure the success of the overall system, and to measure the code quality of functionalities and procedures. Its “pass-fail” method will naturally force continuous evaluation of the system during development needed for a high-quality, time constrained project.
